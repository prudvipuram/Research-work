  Heart failure management includes the perpetuation of life, reduction of symptoms and being more activity. The maintenance of heart failure is very important for the person affected with HF. The Heart failure severity assessment and type prediction are important when the patient condition is analyzed. Thus, for the severity assessment, several symptoms from patients should be observed. 
  The main goal of this study is to find important attributes by which the severity assessment of heart failure is better identified. This goal can be achieved based on classification of data using the machine learning techniques. The data with different attributes in different experiments are given to ML techniques. Then, based on the results of classification (i.e. output of ML techniques) important attributes are selected. The severity assessment is exceptionally helpful, for instance, in remote healthcare monitoring. 
  In this project, the severity assessment is done using three machine learning techniques including CART (classification and regression tree), SVM (support vector machine), and NN (neural networks). Then, the performance of ML techniques is evaluated for each attribute (i.e. symptom) separately. In this study, the results are evaluated such that the attribute which helps to assess the HF severity more accurately is considered as one of the important supportive attributes.
